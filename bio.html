        <p class="bodyp">Jon Bellion was born and raised in Lake Grove, New York, in his parents' house with his sisters and brother. He is of Italian descent and his family comes from Naples. Torn between his love for basketball and music throughout high school, Bellion made the choice to pursue his music career in his junior year. After high school, he enrolled in the music program at the private Five Towns College in Dix Hills, New York. At the age of 19, he decided to drop out of college and focus on writing professionally. He worked under songwriter and Warner Brothers A and R executive Kara DioGuardi for a year and signed a deal through her personal publishing company. Through this experience, Bellion learned how to write songs for different artists, in genres such as rock and hip hop.</p>

        <p class="bodyp ">Bellion continued pursuing his performance career, eventually garnering wider attention after his song "The Monster" was included on Eminem's 2013 album, Marshall Mathers LP 2. The track, which featured a duet between Eminem and Rihanna, topped the charts in 12 countries, including hitting number one on the Billboard 200 in the United States. Also in 2013, Bellion released his debut mixtape, Translation Through Speakers, and followed it late in the year with the Separation mixtape. Featuring the social networking hits "Simple and Sweet" and "Human," a third mixtape, The Definition, appeared in the fall of 2014.</p>

        <p class="bodyp "> The single "All Time Low" arrived in 2015 and accumulated tens of millions of streams by the time his debut album, The Human Condition, was released in June 2016 via Capitol Records. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart. In October 2018, Bellion issued the single "Conversations with My Wife" ahead of the release of the full-length Glory Sound Prep, which arrived later that November and soared to number three on the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart.</p>
